Digital Lightbox
================

Digital Lightbox is a virtual lightbox which allows the manipulation and the comparison of manuscript images.

Currently, the Digital lightbox is tighlty dependent on the Digipal App. Yet, in the early future, I hope to release an independent and standalone app for Django, Node.js and also a Javascript client library.

  - Django 1.4
  - PIL

## TODO
	- Standalone App
	- Django App ready
	- Javascript package only
	- Node.js version
	- Cross-Browser compatibility
	- Performance boost
	- Users platform
		- Database hosting for users' images



##Libraries used:
	- JQuery and JQuery UI
	- Bootstrap
	- LESS
	- Resemble.js
	- Polyfill
	- JQuery Multidraggable
	- GTKNotifications
	- JCrop
